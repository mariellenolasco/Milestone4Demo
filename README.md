# Milestone 4
The Lodging API is now complete! All it needs is a CI/CD pipeline to facilitate integrating future features that could be added to it!

## Goal
Your goal as a developer is to come up with a working pipeline that:
1. Builds the given solution
2. Tests it
3. Runs a code analysis on the solution
4. Deploys the webapp to the world wide web

* Note that you don't need to edit the given solution in any way. You only need to create the pipeline.

### Hint
A sample pipeline.yml file has been provided to base your pipeline on. This sample pipeline is still incomplete (and unusable)!

## Files
### pipeline.yml
Sample pipeline that builds the application. 

### creds.txt
This is where you put in your pipeline credentials. First line must be the organization, second line the project, and the third line will be the definition id of your pipeline.
